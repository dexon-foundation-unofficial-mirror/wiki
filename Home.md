DEXON's fullnode implementation is based on the [go-ethereum](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum) project. These means we are API-compatible with Ethereum.

The JSON-RPC specification is the same as Ethereum, the readers could refer to the [Ethereum Wiki on the fullnode JSON-PRC](https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/JSON-RPC).

To access the testnet, please follow the steps [here](https://github.com/dexon-foundation/wiki/wiki/Access-to-Testnet).
