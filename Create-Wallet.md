# Create Wallet
A cryptocurrency wallet is a store to keep private keys when interacting with blockchains. DEXON foundation provides a chrome extension as wallet for you.

## Precautions
There is still no best practice in protecting private keys when holding/using cryptocurrency. What we provide is simply the most convenient way, use it at your own risk.

### Wallet Secrets
There are three types of secrets when using a DEXON wallet.

#### Password
A password is required when accessing secrets through the wallet, ex.
- export the private key of one account.
- reveal seed phrases.

#### Seed Phrases
The seed phrases composed of 12 or 24 words is used to generate private keys for newly created accounts. Since all private keys generated from one set of seed phrases are identical, it can be used to migrate your account from one computer to another.

#### Accounts
An account in DEXON Wallet is actually a private key, which can be used to interact with DEXON blockchain.

### Risks
If your computer gets hacked, the hacker might stole your account or seed phrases, and transfer your digital assets to somewhere else.

Or you may lose your secrets for some reason. If that happened, no one but GOD can access those digital assets.
