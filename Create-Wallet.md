## Install DEXON Wallet
Please go to this [link](https://dexon.org/faucet) and follow instructions to install DEXON Wallet. If the wallet is freshly installed (not from restoration), you will get 24 seed words, please keep them secretly and safely.

## Create New Accounts
When DEXON wallet successfully installed, a default account would be created and ready to use. If you need more accounts for any reason, you can simply create it via DEXON Wallet:
- click the [blockie](https://github.com/download13/blockies) image on the top-right corner [[/images/blockie.png]]
