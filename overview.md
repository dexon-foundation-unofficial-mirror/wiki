# Introduction

DEXON is a permissionless, proof-of-stake blockchain system that features high throughput and low latency. Current mainnnet is able to reach 10K TPS, and maintain ~ 1 second confirmation latency.

This documentation shows your way around [DEXON](https://dexon.org), the next generation blockchain platform.

## Accessing DEXON Network
