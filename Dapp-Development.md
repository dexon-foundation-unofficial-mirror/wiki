Currently, DEXON uses Ethereum's virtual machine (EVM) as the default VM. So Dapp development on DEXON is exactly the same as on Ethereum. An exception is that if you want to use DEXON's [on-chain random oracle](https://github.com/dexon-foundation/wiki/wiki/On-Chain-Random-Oracle).

DEXON's fork of solidity (called [dsolidity](https://github.com/dexon-foundation/dsolidity)) supports a special built-in variable called `rand`. Here is an example of how to use it:

```
contract Rand {
    uint256 value;

    function update() public {
        value = rand;
    }

    function get() view public returns (uint256) {
        return value;
    }
}
```

This very simple contract demonstrates how to use the `rand` variable. When `update()` is called, the state `value` is assigned to a random value generated by DEXON's on-chain random oracle.

The most simple way to develop Dapps on DEXON is to use the DEXON version of the Remix IDE: https://remix.dexon.org. You should use this with the [Dekusan](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/dekusan/anlicggbddjeebblaidciapponbpegoj) Web Wallet.

If you are developing apps with truffle, you will need to use [dsolidity](https://github.com/dexon-foundation/dsolidity). The nodejs version can also be found [here](https://github.com/dexon-foundation/dsolc-js).

An on-going plan is to allow truffle to support `dsolc-js`. For now, you can simply unbox [hello-dexon](https://github.com/dexon-foundation/hello-dexon).

1. `truffle unbox dexon-foundation/hello-dexon`
2. Use `npm run compile` to compile the final byte-code
3. Deploy onto the DEXON network with myetherwallet or any other tools.
